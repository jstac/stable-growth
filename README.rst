Abstract
----------

This paper considers a neoclassical optimal growth problem where the shock
that perturbs the economy in each time period is potentially unbounded on the
state space.  Sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness and stability of
equilibria are derived in terms of the primitives of the model using recent
techniques from the field of perturbed dynamical systems.
